    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Maile Look, a senior at Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business Information Systems. I’m passionate about using technology—especially AI and data science—to improve people’s lives and empower businesses. My experiences span both technical and interpersonal domains: I’ve built machine learning pipelines, pitched software tools to executive teams, led large-scale campus events, and served as a cheerleader representing OSU with pride and energy. I strive to blend empathy with engineering, curiosity with communication, and analytics with action. Whether I’m working on an AI project or guiding a campus tour, I bring focus, leadership, and an enthusiasm for connecting people and ideas.
